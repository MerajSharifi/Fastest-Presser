# Fastest Presser Game

It is game that two users compete about who can press a key the most times within a set time!
(For practicing Javascript)

A user specifies how long time the game should be, and presses "start game!". When the button is pressed it is about pressing either "L" or "S" on the keyboard. The user that has the highest number of keypresses after the time is up, wins ðŸŽ‰
